- Time complexity:
  The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. 
  The algorithm iterates through each character in the string once, and the operations within 
  the loop (pushing, popping from the stack, and map lookups) are constant time.

- Space complexity:
  The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
  The space used is proportional to the maximum number of elements stored in the stack,
  and in the worst case, it could be equal to the length of the input string.
