Complexity
Time complexity:
The time complexity is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.
Each cell is visited once, and the DFS has a constant time complexity for each cell.

Space complexity:
The space complexity is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.
The additional space is used for the isVisited array, which has a size equal to the grid size.
